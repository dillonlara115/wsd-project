		<p>Hello, My name is Dillon Lara and this is my online portfolio.  I'm a freelance web and graphic designer located in Columbia, MO.  Feel free to take a look around the page and view some of the work I have done so far.  I'm also currently a student at Full Sail University in the Web Design and Development program so I'm looking to build my portfolio while learning more about the evolving world of the internet and web design.  If you are looking to have a website built for your business and do not know where to start and are also on a budget, please get in touch with me by filling out the contact form located at the bottom the site.</p>

		<section>
			<p>I have over 7 years of experience working with web and graphic design using Adobe products including: Master Collection CS3, CS4, and CS5. I also have experience with Microsoft Front Page, Sandvox, and online blogging tools such as WordPress, LiveJournal and Blogger. Much of my experience has come from personal uses such as websites and promotional items(posters, flyers, stickers, buttons) for bands I have played in growing up but I also have done work for churches I have been apart of and other businesses I worked for which included maintaining a webstore and updating pictures for products.</p>
